# Quick Tarot App

## What is this app?
This is a tarot card reading app. 
Currently you can:
* Ask a question, pull a card, and get an answer
* Pull a card and you can interpret what it means to you

It's a fun mini project I've been wanting to start. 
In the future, I hope to add more to this app, but for now, enjoy the simplicity :)

## Running this application
### Backend
cd into the backend folder
uvicorn main:app --reload
