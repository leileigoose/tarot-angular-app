        <h3>What does this app do?</h3>
        <p>This app will let you pull a random tarot card and will give you a quick summary on the card you pulled based on a question you asked. </p>

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Aleia and I am a software developer who is trying to be the very best that no one ever was :)</p>

        <h3>Why did I create this app?</h3>
        <p>This has always been a web app that I wanted to make, but the big push to get started was getting an interview with HDS.<br>
            Their job listing had asked for Angular experience, so I wanted to familiarize myself with the framework.<br>
            This was something I did in 2 days, and I'm  happy with how it's starting to look!<br>
            I hope to continue to improve it--adding more features, asking my artist friends to help with design cards, and just making it something fun to use!<br>
